    <h1>Campfire Coffee</h1>
<h2><em>Where we came from...by Campfire Coffee founder Jo Kuppa</em></h2>
<p>What I have always loved being an outdoor adventurist is waking up and starting your day right. I asked myself, what goes best with the fresh smell of pine, that's a good pot of coffee brewing. While camping one weekend, I noticed that the first cup of coffee from the morning campfire is uniquely wonderful and delicious. So I thought to myself how can I recreate that same taste back in the rat race back home. So I made it my mission to bring the feeling and the taste of the outdoors something I can experience every day. I thought if I can't be in the woods I'm going to make the woods come to me.</p>

<h2><em>Where I wanted to go...</em></h2>
<p>I worked with the best of the best in the coffee roasting world and came up with a recipe that will not be rivaled. I created a way to bring that campfire experience to your home kitchen, on the city side walk, in the office kichenette. We roast these beans to capture  the robust flavor of the bean and the raw effect of a camp stove perculator to your morning cup.

<h2><em>Where we at at..</em>.

<p> We have successfully recreated that flavor back in civilization. So whether you are at camp, on the beach with your family or on the mountain you won't be far from you favorite <em>Campfire Coffee</em> because your favorite coffee will be at a local stand near you!</p>
